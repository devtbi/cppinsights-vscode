# C++ Insights for Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

<!-- ## Introduction -->

<!-- ## Features

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow. -->

## Features
This extension allows you to view C++ Insights inside of vscode:
<p>
  <img src="image/show.png" alt="Show C++ insights" />
</p>

or diff the Insights with your original source:
<p>
  <img src="image/diff.png" alt="Diff source with C++ insights" />
</p>

The extension can utilize a compilation database/compile commands for easy use in existing environments. You can specify a directory containing the compilation database, aka the  build directory, with `vscode-cppinsights.buildDirectory`.
If the active file is part of a workspace, and `vscode-cppinsights.buildDirectoryPrioritizeCMake` is set, the `cmake.buildDirecotry` is used to determine the build direcotry.
